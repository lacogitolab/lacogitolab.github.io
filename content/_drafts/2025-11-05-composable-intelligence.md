From a physical point of view, everything in the world, from stones to brains,
is composed of material units such as quarks and atoms. This perspective
inspires us to consider intelligence from a material basis as well. In this
article, I present a novel perspective on understanding intelligence, drawn
from observations of biological intelligence and the limitations of neural
network based AI. I call it **Composable Intelligence**, a new way of thinking
about how intelligence might evolve or be continuously constructed from a
hierarchical point of view, applicable to both biological and artificial
systems.

## The Framework

Building on this idea, a new framework, illustrated in the figure above, called
*Topological Coupling Meta Representation* (TCRM), is proposed to guide the
engineering of such a practical system. From the bottom up, there are four
foundational layers that together build intelligence:

- Representative Carriers: The physical and atomic representations of concepts,
  facts, reasoning cues, and so on. Although they may take different forms in
  different intelligent systems, they must exist concretely and possess
  reactive capabilities, interacting with each other or with other components
  of the system.

- Reactive Couplings: The underlying mechanism of continual and evolving
  learning. New knowledge or experience emerges through the construction of new
  instances or coupling structures. Gradual forgetting occurs through the
  disappearance or decay of existing couplings. In this sense, reactive
  coupling should be self organizing and open ended rather than closed.

- Compositional Meta Structures: Stable and reusable units formed from reactive
  couplings to perform higher level and more complex functions such as
  self-reflection and memory retention. These structures are observable,
  measurable, and interferable regarding functionality.

- Scaling Topology: A topological structure, such as a graph, with nonlinear
  scaling ability built upon the meta structures. The entire system grows to be
  both wide and deep, enabling richer and more integrated forms of
  intelligence.

## Representative Carriers

In Composable Intelligence, we regard intelligence as a physical and objective
process, something that like everything else in the world exists within
substance. The core and foundation of intelligence are materials, which I call
Representative Carriers. These carriers differ across various forms of
intelligence: biological neural cells, vector of artificial neural networks, or
symbols in expert AI systems. Although we don't even know everything about
underlying machenism of carriers such as biological neurons, it is
fundamentally vital to master how to observe, control, and enhance them.

Understanding or designing a controllable representative carrier for a specific
form of intelligence is not trivial. However, achieving this is often limited
by the SOTA of inspection technologies. Even today, it is far from clear what
the actual representative carriers of human brain intelligence are. Are they
stored in biochemical materials? Or do they emerge from dynamic activities such
as resting and active potential changes? Or perhaps they lie in the
connectivity patterns of neural networks?

AI research based on computational paradigms, whether through simulation or
imitation, provides us, at least theoretically, with a wide range of tools and
resources to experiment with different designs of representative carriers. On
the other hand, after decades of AI development, we have only gained practical
experience with two main forms of representative carriers: symbols in expert AI
systems, and embedding vectors in machine learning and modern deep neural
networks. We have been blinded by short-term practical achievements and have
ignored some of the core problems that truly deserve attention in the long run.

## Reactive Coupling

Built upon representative carries is a layer performing Reactive Coupling. This
is a basis concept challenging current end-to-end training of ANN architectures
such as GPT models.
