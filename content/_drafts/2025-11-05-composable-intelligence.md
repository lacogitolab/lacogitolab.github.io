From a physical point of view, everything in the world, from stones to brains,
is composed of material units, such as quarks and atoms. This perspective
inspires us to consider intelligence from a material basis as well. In this
article, I present a novel perspective on understanding intelligence, drawn
from observations of biological intelligence and the limitations of neural
network–based AI. I call it **Composable Intelligence**, which is a new way of
thinking about how intelligence might evolve or be constructed from a
hierarchical point of view. Building on this idea, I introduce a new framework
called **Topological Coupling Meta Representation** (TCRM), which aims to guide
the engineering of such a practical system.

## Representative Carriers

In Composable Intelligence, we regard intelligence as a physical and objective
process, something that like everything else in the world exists within
substance. The core and foundation of intelligence are materials, which I call
Representative Carriers. These carriers differ across various forms of
intelligence: biological neural cells, vector of artificial neural networks, or
symbols in expert AI systems. Although we don't even know everything about
underlying machenism of carriers such as biological neurons, it is
fundamentally vital to master how to observe, control, and enhance them.

Understanding or designing a controllable representative carrier for a specific
form of intelligence is not trivial. However, achieving this is often limited
by the SOTA of inspection technologies. Even today, it is far from clear what
the actual representative carriers of human brain intelligence are. Are they
stored in biochemical materials? Or do they emerge from dynamic activities such
as resting and active potential changes? Or perhaps they lie in the
connectivity patterns of neural networks?

Fortunately, AI research based on computational paradigms, whether through
simulation or imitation, provides us, at least theoretically, with a wide range
of tools and resources to experiment with different designs of representative
carriers. On the other hand, after decades of AI development, we have only
gained practical experience with two main forms of representative carriers:
symbols in expert AI systems, and embedding vectors in machine learning and
modern deep neural networks. We have been blinded by short-term practical
achievements and have ignored some of the core problems that truly deserve
attention in the long run.

## Reactive Coupling

Built upon representative carries is a layer performing Reactive Coupling. This
is a basis concept challenging current end-to-end training of ANN architectures
such as GPT models.
