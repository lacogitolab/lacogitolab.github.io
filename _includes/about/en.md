I am a systems-oriented engineer and researcher driven by long-term thinking about how humans and machines compute, reason, and collaborate. With a dual background in **optical physics** and **computer science**, and nearly a decade of industry experience in **cloud-native data and AI platforms** since 2016, I focus on building infrastructures that bridge incremental engineering progress with more fundamental shifts in computational paradigms.

Inspired by large-scale systems such as data lakehouses and by multi-paradigm representations exemplified by projects like *Wolfram Alpha*, my work centers on unifying **data analytics**, **AI workloads**, and **resource-aware execution** into coherent, scalable systems. I combine academic rigor with production-grade engineering, aiming to push systems beyond short-term optimization toward enduring architectural clarity.

## Open-Source & Community

I actively engage in open-source and community initiatives that explore the foundations and future directions of data and AI systems:

- **awesome-public-data** — Founder  
  A long-running community curating high-quality public datasets for research and education.  
  https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets

- **LambdaCogito** — Founder  
  An experimental community exploring computational logic, language theory, and next-generation data architectures.  
  https://github.com/lacogitolab

- **cogents** — Research prototypes on cognitive and agent-oriented systems  
  https://www.xiaming.site/2025/08/30/project-cogents/

- **graphsim** — Graph similarity and structural analysis algorithms  
  https://github.com/caesar0301/graphsim

These efforts reflect my belief that meaningful system innovation emerges from open exploration beyond immediate production constraints.

## Personal Philosophy & Interests

I believe that genuine optimism lies in discovering meaning within the apparent aimlessness of life. My family is the anchor of my world and the quiet force behind my professional persistence and long-term vision.

Outside of work, I enjoy Chinese calligraphy, maintaining an aquarium, traveling, reading, and reflective thinking. I am deeply inspired by science fiction, especially *Star Trek*, theoretical physics, and the evolving narrative of human knowledge.
